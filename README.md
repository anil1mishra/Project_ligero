The person_counter_electricity_consumption file checks whether a person entered or exited the room and also gives the units of electricity consumed by each appliance on the android application.
The detector.py file divides the room into various regions. If presence is detected in that region, the appliances connected to that region will be switched on. If no presence in that region, the appliances will be off.
